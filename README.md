Using the principles of OOP, create a custom class and then instantiate objects using 
that class and the new operator.


This website is a memory game. You click on the cards and try to match each card to their twin. The cards will flip back over if the cards you hit don't match. You are trying to remember where each card is and get them to stay on the screen once they match.  We used HTML, JS, CSS, sass, OOP, Bundling and modules to build this website.


When building this website we had some help with the Java script. We had a tutor helping us learn how to do OOP, Module and bundling. Her name was Tiffany, She sent us a website that would help us build out the OPP and modules. (https://www.theodinproject.com/). We followed a video posted on Marcos's homepage to assist us with the bundling. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02ehdTzi3I). For the reset button we used a stackoverflow to find the proper code to make the reset button work corrrectly (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71475445/restart-button-using-html-js).
