Using the principals of OOP, create a custom class and then instantiate objects using that class and the new operator.

This webiste is a memory game. You click on the cards and try to match each card to their twin. The cards will fip back over if the cards you hit dont match. You are tryingt to rember where each card is and get them to stay on the screen once they matcg.  To build this website we used html, js, css, sass, OOP, Bundling and modules. 

When building this website we had some help with the java script. We had a tutor helping us learn how to do OOP, Module an bundling. Her name was Tiffany, She sent us a website that would help us build out the OPP and modules. (https://www.theodinproject.com/). We followed a video that was posted on Marcos home page to assist us with the budling. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R02ehdTzi3I).
